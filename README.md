# ORIE-Solar-Grazing

This repo includes the [spreadsheet](https://github.coecis.cornell.edu/rd532/ORIE-Solar-Grazing/blob/main/Solar%20Grazing%20v1.3.1.xlsx) files which capture the solar grazing operation that we are exploring along with mild [data visualizations](https://github.coecis.cornell.edu/rd532/ORIE-Solar-Grazing/blob/main/Data%20Tables%20-%20Solar%20Grazing.xlsx). There is also a [integer linear program](https://github.coecis.cornell.edu/rd532/ORIE-Solar-Grazing/blob/main/solargrazing1.ipynb) written in Python utilizing Gurobi for our base model. This base model seeks to maximize the Net Present Value of cash flows over a time horizon across different initial flock purchase amounts while adhering to a parameterized flock dynamic. One can adjust these parameters, including site attributes, flock attributes, financial attributes, and costs, in the Python file with the appropriate setter and getter functions. We aim to further segment time-indexed flock size variables (currently n[t]) and time-indexed Ewes-to-sell variables (currently m[t]) by 5 age groups, with the starting flock being uniformly divided across these age groups.

Note that in the [mathematical model](https://github.coecis.cornell.edu/rd532/ORIE-Solar-Grazing/blob/main/Solar_Grazing.pdf), the constraints on the variables for Ewes-to-sell differ from the spreadsheet and Gurobi model. We felt that it was more realistic to allow the farmer to decide how many of his Ewes he can sell at the end of the year regardless of whether it exceeds the maximum flock size. We will adjust the Gurobi model to match this, but these variables in the spreadsheet will still be exactly equal to the number of Ewes that exceed the maximum flock size (0 if there's no excess) for ease of visualizing how the outputs derive from the inputs as well as the yearly progression.
